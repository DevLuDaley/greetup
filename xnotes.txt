What is the purpose of get /signup
:get them to a page wherre they can signup
:render the signup form


#sinatra - in sinatra the method matches - http verb
#bcrypt allows us to call "password" instead of password_digest in the views and controllers


:persist data to the database
#need to use params to persist the data
shuttle buss between views and controllers


#signup "name" becomes keys for params input hash
{:name, :username, :password}

<input type="text" name="name" value="">
<input type="text" name="user_name" value="">
<input type="text" name="password" value="">
<input type="submit" name="" value="Create User">

#redirect - why do we do it vs erb?
##erb = app_controller tells program path to erb => set :views, "app/views" 
###redirect = request that we are sending - result is a new http get request
####it's a better choice because 
######"get" requests are best for "getting" a new page
#######separation of concerns - 1 job per route i.e in block of a post route use redirect to "get" a page instead of erb since it is for "get" reqs
####### erb give access to instance variables within block - before erb is called/rendered

# 1 job per route --- "post" job = 'create' a new user SO... use redirect to 'show' new user

#should I redirect or should I render -> "what route are you in and what's it's job?"
##rarely render (erb :) from a post patch or delete request
###maybe allowing a user to fix an invalid form
#get /:"" = dynamic


#when we have a get request with data that it received from the db we'll need to have an erb/render so that we can use that variable within our code


Rack::MethodOverride allows me to change the  http method of a verb.

patch because I'm changing info

need to fix => any user can access form and edit info


Active record methods to update Journal entry





FIX

App_controller

-Errors stemming from "if !logged_in?"

In - GreetupsController 
    - /index route is broken
    set_greetup
    
    
    - LD can access/edit/delete ND's greetup at route greetups/19 aka http://127.0.0.1:9393/greetups/19

PRIVATE = something that we won't call/use outside of this class.

difference between Active Record's DESTROY and DELETE methods.
destroy runs callbacks on the model while delete doesn't

GET req/methods/verbs return erb/render
POST/PATCH/etc all redirect (separation of concerns)
